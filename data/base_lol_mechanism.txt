Minion
.

 
Minions
 are units that comprise the main force sent by the 
Nexus
. They spawn periodically from their Nexus and advance along a lane towards the enemy Nexus, automatically engaging any enemy unit or structure they encounter. They are controlled by artificial intelligence and only use 
basic attacks
.

A group of spawned minions is called a 
wave
. The game's pace fundamentally depends on minion waves.

Spawning location and routes

These graphics show the points at which minions spawn right beside each Nexus, and the route they follow after being spawned, for each available map:

 
Summoner's Rift
 
Howling Abyss

The thick, short segments at each line's end represent the spawning point for each lane (the point at which minions appear on the map).

The thin, long segments represent the minions' regular route along each lane that they march along immediately after spawning.

Gameplay - Summoner's Rift

Minion waves

Minions start spawning from each 
Nexus
 at 
1:05
 and keep spawning in waves every 30 seconds for the rest of the match. Each wave comprises several types of minions, which spawn in this order:

 
Super minions

If a team's inhibitor is destroyed, one super minion spawns for the enemy team on the same lane as the destroyed inhibitor.

If all of a team's inhibitors are destroyed, two super minions spawn on each lane for the enemy team instead.

 
Melee minions

Three of them spawn in each wave.

 
Siege minions

They do not spawn on waves in which 
 
super minions
 are present.

For the first 15 minutes, one spawns every three waves.

After the 15 minute mark, one spawns every two waves.

After the 25 minute mark, one spawns every wave.

 
Caster minions

Three of them spawn in each wave.

Behavior

While minions have not acquired a target, they will strictly path linearly along a lane until they find a valid enemy unit. Upon finding one, they will move toward and attack it within their range. Minions respect unit collision as well as 
player-generated terrain
.

The 
first wave
's minions have modified behaviour. Top and bottom lanes' minions are ghosted for 28 seconds, while middle lane minions are ghosted for 18 seconds. They will ignore enemy champions until a champion walks much closer to them or until meeting with the enemy wave. When the waves meet, minions will spread out their attacks on the three enemy melee minions regardless of distance. This special behavior exists so that, in every game, neither side gains a pushing advantage without champion interference since the first wave's melee minions are guaranteed to die at roughly the same time.

Nearby enemy minions will become aggressive toward, or "
aggro
", an enemy champion within their own 
 
variable acquisition range
 and under certain conditions. When activated by enemy champion actions, this aggression is formally referred to as a 
Call for Help signal
 in-game and throughout the wiki, and it is indicated by an icon of three concentrated lines above a minion's health bar (this icon indicates all non-playable units' aggro, including 
 
monsters
, 
 
turrets
, 
 
pets
, etc.).

Abilities interacting with 
 / 
 minion 
Call for Help
 specifically, is noted under their respective "Details" section within a formatted table (
which includes other fundamental ability properties
).

Call for Help signals trigger when:

A champion stands in the minion's path, without any other targets within the minions' attack range and outside of a 
turret
's range.

A champion deals damage to an enemy champion with a basic attack, the majority of 
unit-targeted
 abilities, and a minority of abilities which are marked as being similar to those two. Minions will prioritize the closest champion in the case there are multiple sources.

Bar the first wave (which is noted above as an exception), Call for Help signals are also ignored while minions are already attacking an enemy turret.

Priority

When minions find several enemy units, they choose their target using a priority system that follows this order:

Enemy champions attacking an allied champion.

Enemy minions attacking an allied champion.

Enemy minions attacking an allied minion.

Enemy turrets attacking an allied minion.

Enemy champions attacking an allied minion.

The closest enemy minion.

The closest enemy champion.

Once a minion has chosen a target, it only switches to a new target if that new target has a higher priority. The minion cannot acquire a new target that has the same priority as their current target (and thus continues attacking its current target).

Acquisition Range

In general, valid targets must be within 500 units of the minion in order to be acquired.

Allied champions being attacked by an enemy champion may be within 1000 range of the minion instead.

Timing

Minions reevaluate their target in between each attack windup every few seconds. For instance, if an enemy champion is attacking an allied champion and stops doing so, minions will not stop targeting that champion for a short time afterwards.

Vision

When the minion loses sight of its target, the minion switches to a new target or keeps advancing if there are no targets left within sight.

Stats mechanics

Minions "upgrade" strictly every 90 seconds (i.e., every third wave), gaining 
Champions killed with Comeuppance (R)
health
, 
Champions hit with Bandage Toss (Q) at greater than 75% of max range
attack damage
, and possibly certain 
buffs
 depending on the game state.

Minions deal 50% reduced damage to enemy champions.

Minions start with 325 base 
 
Champions killed 5s before or after using Chronobreak (R)
movement speed
 and gain 
25 / 50 / 75 / 100 (based on minutes)
 movement speed as the game time progresses.

After the first wave and before 14 minutes, all top and bottom lane minions gain bonus movement speed. This increase matches the time it takes for top and bottom lanes' minions and midlane minions to reach the midpoint of each lane, as the side lanes are longer than the middle lane.

New spawning minions level up based on their team's average (integer) champion level (e.g. champion levels 15, 10, 18 = minion level 14). Minion levels interact with the minion pushing buff explained below.

Buffs

General

Destroying an enemy inhibitor grants a small buff to allied minions in the lane where the inhibitor has been destroyed.

Minion Pushing

On 
 
Summoner's Rift

The team with the higher average champion level gains the minion pushing buff. The buff increases the minion damage against enemy minions and reduces the damage they take from them.

Bonus damage
 = (5% + (5% × 
Turret advantage of the lane
)) × 
Team level advantage

Damage reduction
 = 1 + (
Turret advantage of the lane
 × 
Team level advantage
)

Team level advantage is the difference between the (decimal) average of the (integer) levels of the players in one team and the average of the levels of the other. This difference can be a decimal value, and is capped at 3.

Turret advantage is the difference between the number of turrets destroyed in one team on a specific lane and the number of turrets destroyed on the other team on that same lane. Note that Nexus turrets are not lane turrets. This difference cannot be below 0.

Since there are three turrets on each lane, the maximum possible benefits on Summoner's Rift are: 

Bonus damage
 = (5% + (5% × 3)) × 3 = 60%

Damage reduction
 = 1 + (3 × 3) = 10

This buff starts to apply at 3:30. Already-spawned minions will also receive the buff and these values will update for all minions when the level and turret advantages change.

On 
 
Howling Abyss

Minions in the team with higher average champion level receive a buff that reduces damage taken from enemy minions.

Damage reduction
 = 
Level advantage
 × 
Turret advantage

Team level advantage is the difference between the (decimal) average of the (integer) levels of the players in one team and the average of the levels of the other. This difference can be a decimal value, and is 
not
 capped.

Turret advantage is the difference between the number of inner and nexus turrets destroyed for each team.

This buff starts to apply at 3:30. Already-spawned minions will also receive the buff and these values will update for all minions when the level and turret advantages change.

Creep Score

Creep Score
, or 
CS
, is the number of minions, monsters, and champion pets a champion has slain by dealing the killing blow to these units. Dealing this hit is known as 
last hitting
 and is considered one of the most important skills in League of Legends.

Every minion is worth 1 CS.

In the early- and mid-game, CS along with 
KDA
 can be used to measure a player's performance against their lane opponent.

Wave Gold Value

In 
Summoner's Rift
, an undistributed wave consists of three 
 
melee minions
, three 
 
caster minions
 and possibly a 
 
siege minion
.

As of 
V8.23
, a 
minion wave
 has an 
average
 gold value that varies from 
 
125
 and up to 
 
195
 at 25:00.

Wave Strategy

Without player interference, a lane's wave is neither advancing or retreating in any significant amount.

A minion wave that catches up with its preceding wave starts pushing the lane towards enemy turret.

Big waves of minions can overwhelm a turret.

When a player interrupts an enemy minion wave, ensuring their minions deal more damage to the opponent's minions than they are receiving, the lane starts to 
push
.

In the simplest way, this is done by killing every minion in a wave without interference from your own minions. This changes where in the lane the minion waves clash.

On more sophisticated turning the player makes sure their side is making just slightly more damage thus allowing the wave to build up as the wave gets reinforcements before than the enemy wave.

Game Terminology

Some game terms related to minions:

Farming
: Last hitting minions to earn gold and experience.

Lane Momentum
: The strength with which the minions in a lane advance without champion aid.

Pushing
: Attacking enemy minions to keep allied minions alive and allow them to advance along their lane.

Freezing
: Preventing enemy minions from pushing the lane without pushing them back.

"Winions"
: A wave of minions so big or so strong that it can destroy 
turrets
, 
nexuses
, or champions without champion aid.

Free Farming
: Farming without being confronted by an enemy champion.

Proxy Farming
: Farming behind an enemy tower. It's easier than conventional farming because there is no interference from allied minions, but it's usually much more dangerous.

Split Pushing
: Attacking several objectives at the same time when at least one of the objectives is a lane turret.

Trivia

If the game plays out without champion interference, the minions in one of the teams will eventually win the game. The team that wins is random.

When minions acquire a target, it is possible for a champion to pick up aggro multiple times from a minion. Minions can constantly pick up aggro from you and can follow you through the jungle.

By default, each player sees their allied minions and structures in 
Summoner's Rift
 in blue and the enemy minions and structures in red. This is just a visual effect, it has no practical effects in the game.

Previously, midlane minions had reduced gold bounties, which lasted until 14:00 (until the wave at 13:35). The gold penalty was ultimately removed in 
V13.12
.

Between 
V10.23
 and 
V12.21
, midlane siege minions were worth 
 
10
 less. Compared to other lanes, the total amount of gold from midlane minions was 
 
80
 less.

Between 
V12.22
 and 
V13.11
, all midlane minions were worth 
 
1
 less (i.e., siege minions were in total worth 
 
1
 less instead of 
 
10
 less than their regular bounty as before). Compared to other lanes, the total amount of gold from midlane minions was 
 
164
 less.

Blue Siege Minion in beta is a mobile ballista.

The unused Blue Siege Minion model in beta also became the now Blue Siege Minion.

Visually, Blue 
Super Minion
's pilots use two control sticks similar to analog sticks on 
Siege Minions
 to control their mech while Red 
Super Minion
's pilots control their mech with a red crystal sphere, suggesting that magic is used.

========================================

For the plants, see 
Jungle plants
.

On maps that have multiple lanes, 
the 
jungle
 consists of the parts of the map between the lanes proper, excluding the teams' bases, characterized by the lack of vision or dense 
Fog of War
. 
Neutral
—not aggressive unless attacked—creeps called 
 
monsters
 live in the jungle, and a monster or group of monsters at a certain location of the map is called a 
camp
.

Jungling
 encompasses three specialized responsibilities of the 
jungler
. These contrast with 
laners'
, whose primary purpose is to farm minions and defend their lane's structures in the earlier stages of the game.

Farming
 the jungle, meaning the slaying of monster camps.

Having access to the 
 
Smite
 summoner spell in order to secure epic monster objectives, which are beneficial to the entire ally team (
 
Voidgrubs
, 
 
Rift Herald
, 
 
Baron Nashor
, and 
 
Drakes
).

And lastly, because of the jungle's extent, generally assisting and influencing lanes.

History

Basis

The primary reason for a jungler to exist is to maximize resource allocation. The jungle offers a lot of 
 
gold
 and 
 
Champions killed with Trueshot Barrage (R)
experience
 that can be accessed through slaying the monsters that spawn and respawn in predetermined locations on the map. With a lone player dedicating themself to accruing them, more resources can then be collected in lanes by the laners, rather than sharing them with another teammate. This is especially important for solo laners, who can possibly earn the highest amount of gold and experience from creeps on the team.

The structure of the map also naturally leads to that resource acquirement being done in desired 
paths
, formally called 
pathing
, as some camps are closer to each other and/or some camps may be prioritized over others as desired. Because the jungler can obviously only be situated close to one half of the map at a time, this 
pathing
 also determines which lanes or objectives are within their more immediate sphere of influence. Minimizing the time and resources spent clearing camps is imperative for a jungler to be able to have priority over further camps, fights, other objectives, and general pressuring of the enemy team. The farming of camps is generally balanced to be able to be done in cycles while both champions and monsters level up and become more powerful as the game goes on. Junglers that are ahead will cycle monsters much faster, allowing more free time between the camps' killing and the camps' respawning, as well as being able to farm the next cycle of monsters much faster too.

The jungler, much like any roaming role, can undertake the initiating of ambushes against enemies in order to overpower the enemy in numbers. Ambushes against laners within the lanes are called 
ganks
, and the lack of natural vision in the jungle heavily facilitates this. This means laners also have to be mindful and avoid 
ganks
 through proper vision and 
zone control
, or defend against them through various means such as a 
counter-gank
.

Lastly but not least, access to 
 
Smite
 as the jungler additionally provides them with a clear advantage in taking down jungle monsters compared to laners, and agency over important epic monster objectives and the game.

Camp Farming

General combat

See 
Monster
 for details on monsters' behavior, such as patience.

Farming, or "clearing", a camp is done within each camp's 
leash range
, indicated by a circle around the camp when initiating combat with its monsters. Outside of that leash range, the monsters will start to lose patience and eventually automatically regenerate any damage taken and run back to their original position (= reset).

During combat, the attacker can create a window of timing where they can avoid incoming damage by moving away from the monster before it can start winding up an attack, while also potentially retaliating—a 
 
ranged
 champion can perform this more consistently, since they are able to attack at a longer range than monsters' attack range. As a general rule, large monsters may either move or attack slower (or both move and attack slower) than most champions as the game goes on.

Monsters will always attack the nearest champion regardless of having 
 
vision
 of them or not. A change of targets can alert a team of the presence of an enemy nearby. Monsters will attempt to follow a target into 
 
brush
, and not immediately "forget" that an attacker has hidden in them.

Jungle items

In order to incentivize junglers to be able to farm camps in a compelling way and better than laners, junglers are provided with exclusive and essential 
jungle items
. These items also ensure laners practically cannot gain much from farming camps rather than lane minions, especially during the 
early game
. Conversely, junglers gain heavily reduced 
Champions killed with Trueshot Barrage (R)
experience
 for farming lane 
 
minions
, because of their jungle item.

 
Gustwalker Hatchling

 
Mosstomper Seedling

 
Scorchclaw Pup

Purchasing a jungle item summons the respective type of pet to assist the jungler in clearing camps by dealing significant damage and restoring them health and mana. In order to be most efficient, the jungle item must be purchased at the start of the game, because it allows the jungler to gain increased gold and experience bounties for killing jungle camps in general, as well as feed their pet treats for each large monster killed to gain certain bonuses for themselves. The pet can be evolved at certain thresholds of treats to grant the jungler a powerful permanent buff based on their type of pet and unlock access to the 
 
Smite
 upgrades: 
 
Unleashed Smite
 for the first evolution, and 
 
Primal Smite
 for the final evolution.

In 
 
Classic
 5v5 
 
Summoner's Rift
, those evolution thresholds are at 20 and 40 treats, respectively.

Camp recycling

The level of monsters is calculated from the average champion level of both teams in the game at the time of their spawning, with the exception of epic monsters which upgrade based on game time. As their level increases, so does their 
 
experience
 bounty, but also their health and damage. It is therefore important, especially at the earliest stages of the game, for the jungler to pick a pathing that allows them to reach certain levels by clearing camps most efficiently, thus creating a cycle for them to respawn and be cleared again sooner, and enabling the jungler to accrue even more gold and experience on their own.

Monsters' bounties differ; regardless of this, (and assuming the jungler is not gaining experience from other sources than their jungle yet) clearing the first camp of the game will always level up the jungler to level 2. Some monsters, such as the 
 
Mini Krug
 or the 
 
Lesser Raptor
, may not be as important to kill in order to achieve certain level breakpoints, since their bounties are exceptionally low.

Champions evidently take much longer to clear camps in the earlier stages, while some junglers may lose a lot of health or time if they start fighting monsters alone, even with a jungle item. To solve this, the jungler may ask for a "
leash
" for their first ever camp of the game, where the allies essentially contribute some damage to the camp so that it can be taken faster. Regardless, this strategy is not always optimal for laners, because they may lose control of the lane earlier on. Balance changes for the jungle camps and junglers' starting items have made leashing less and less important over the years, but it remains an important strategy to situationally employ in certain games nonetheless.

On 
 
Summoner's Rift
, the assisting allies are specifically only the top or bot laners, since minions in the midlane arrive much sooner than top and bottom lane relative to camps spawning.

Timers

Live camps are marked on the minimap with a diamond icon at their distinct locations. When there are 60 seconds until their spawning, an hourglass icon will appear at their location on the minimap and will be greyed out. At 10 seconds until their spawning, the icon becomes highlighted. Visual spawn timers are only available for the 
 
Red Brambleback
, 
 
Blue Sentinel
, 
 
Voidgrubs
, 
 
Rift Herald
, 
 
Baron Nashor
 and 
 
Drake
 camps. Their timers can also be viewed in the 
scoreboard
.

If a team has vision of a camp when it is cleared, the exact spawn timer can be calculated, as the respawn takes 135 seconds (2:15) for a regular camp and 300 seconds (5:00) for the 
 
Red Brambleback
 and 
 
Blue Sentinel
 camps specifically. It is important to note that the respawn timer for the latter two can appear on the minimap if a team gains 
 
vision
 of the camp's location, regardless of if the team had vision of the camp when it was slain. An epic monster camp being slain is announced to both teams, so their exact spawn timer will always be known to everyone.

Invading

Invading
 is the act of walking into the enemy half of the jungle with the intent of gaining information, and if done by a jungler, potentially stealing away camps. Invading can severely impact the ability of the enemy jungler to cycle their own camp, and the ally team can utilize the information gained from invading for various decisions and strategies themselves.

Counter-jungling
 is the act of invading with the express intent of stealing away camps to cover a known deficit. For example, if the enemy jungler is confirmed to have invaded and cleared the ally Raptor camp, the ally jungler can counter this by invading to clear an enemy camp themselves, potentially equalizing the difference.

Both invading and counter-jungling can become an explosive cause for fighting, as laners come to scare or fend off the invaders on their own or assist the jungler in a skirmish to try to ambush them.

Ganking

Ganking
 refers to the act of ambushing one or more laners within their lane, with the intent of scoring 
 
takedowns
. While the act of ganking is not exclusive to junglers, it is one of the primary activities expected from the jungler earlier in the game, because they are not bound to any particular lane. This free-roaming nature within the jungle's Fog of War can render their decisions somewhat unexpected (though still more expected than the 
 
Support
 who can truly freely roam despite starting in the bottom lane; the jungler actually has to go to camps and farm them at some point).

The vast majority of viable junglers are given explicit tools to be able to gank effectively and be the primary facilitator for their team: a mix of 
 
crowd control
, gap closers, and burst damage.

Not all junglers are meant to be ganking often, though. Some junglers benefit from the potential safety of farming in the jungle rather than lanes against opponents constantly contesting them, and are more efficient in clearing camps than ganking due to lack of the aforementioned tools. This renders them more of a carry instead of a facilitator, and separates junglers into two main categories. If a jungler has very good 
base stats
 and tools for ganking early in the game, and prefers to gank often to get their team ahead, they are referred to as a "ganking jungler". On the other hand, if a jungler is better served accruing as many resources as possible while ganking less often, and then potentially becoming a primary 
carry
 with massive resource leads over the opponent, they are referred to as a "farming jungler". Both strategies are valid, but the extent of "preferring ganking" vs "preferring farming" differs from champion to champion and even from one 
balance patch
 to another.

 
Summoner's Rift
 Jungle Overview

On Summoner's Rift, there are 6 regular monster camps per side. The blue- and red-side jungles have an equal area and the same number and type of non-boss monsters, except mirrored across the river:

 
Raptors

 
Wolves

 
Krugs

 
Gromp

 
Blue Sentinel

 
Red Brambleback

Epic monsters break this symmetry, but still do reside on opposite sides of the river:

 
Voidgrubs
, 
 
Rift Herald
 and 
 
Baron Nashor
 reside in the 
baron pit
 at the top half of the map, sheltered closer to the red side but only open to the blue side.

 
Drakes

 for an overview of jungling changes over the years.

Hide
Show

Jungler itemization has gone through some considerable changes over the course of the game's lifespan, mainly owing to the unique difficulty in balancing a relatively unorthodox role with the more traditional laning mechanics.

During 
Season One
, the jungle was a highly profitable source of gold, so much so that often a Jungling champion could even obtain more farm than the lanes with some effort, eventually letting them afford expensive and deadly items if their farming efforts were not halted. This was offset by the enormous difficulty of the jungle monsters of the time - there were extremely few junglers who could even clear effectively in such an rigorous environment and even fewer junglers who could begin the game with anything other than a 
 
Cloth Armor
 and 5 
 
Health Potions
.

The jungle rework of 
Season Two
 reduced the difficulty of the jungle monsters and the gold and experience that they gave out in an attempt to open the jungle to more prospective champions. Despite the decreased monster health, however, it was found that the decreased gold meant that dedicated farming was simply no longer an economically viable strategy, and many junglers were forced to find alternative solutions to the resultant gold starvation (most often amounting to early stacking of gold generating items such as 
 
Philosopher's Stone
 and 
 
Heart of Gold
), while other junglers whose core item builds often demanded a high gold income to be feasible simply could not function in such a low-gold environment.

The jungle in 
Season Three
 attempted to compromise between the high farm of Season One and the low difficulty of Season Two. The introduction of 
 
Hunter's Machete
 allowed many junglers to successfully clear without many sustain issues and offered fallback solutions in the form of the highly 
gold efficient
 items it built into in case of a poor early game, and the increase to passive gold generation saw most junglers in possession of at least passable amounts of gold. These changes saw the number of viable junglers increase greatly.

Season Four
 was built upon the framework set by Season Three, with several gameplay refinements aimed at combating issues seen at higher levels of play. Of particular note, all of the high-tier jungle items provided benefits exclusively involving killing monsters and an entirely new jungle monster, 
 
Wight
, was introduced, enabling much higher potential profits to both farming junglers who are sufficiently fast to keep up with the respawn times of the four camps and ganking junglers who do not perform well early on. These buffs to farming junglers were boosted further with the addition of 
 
Feral Flare
, which provided massive bonuses to junglers who could farm fast enough to acquire the upgrade early on. On the flipside, the addition of 
 
Quill Coat
 kept slower utility junglers useful during a metagame period dominated by heavy early offense.

In 
Season Five
, the jungle received a major update that coincided with the Summoner's Rift visual update. It introduced 4 items that upgraded 
 
Smite
: 
 
Poacher's Knife
, 
 
Ranger's Trailblazer
, 
 
Skirmisher's Sabre
, and 
 
Stalker's Blade
. On top of that, four unique enchantments to those items that diversified champions and granted them unique Legendary-item tier statistics and effects: 
 
Warrior
 
 
Cinderhulk
, 
 
Runic Echoes
, and 
 
Warrior
. It also added new effects to jungle camps to the jungler when 
 
Smite
 was used on those camps: 
 
Gromp
 would grant a buff that poisoned enemies when attacked; 
 
Ancient Krug
 would grant a buff that stunned jungle monsters every 5 basic attacks or dealt bonus true damage against turrets; 
 
Crimson Raptor
 would grant a buff that revealed wards when detected; 
 
Greater Murk Wolf
 would spawn a sentry that would alert the presence of an enemy champion; 
 
Blue Sentinel
 would restore a portion of 
Champions hit by Piltover Peacemakers (Q) at greater than 75% of max range
maximum
 mana
; and 
 
Red Brambleback
 would restore a portion of 
Champions killed with Comeuppance (R)
maximum
 health
. 

In 
Season Six
, 
 
Poacher's Knife
 and 
 
Ranger's Trailblazer
 were replaced by 
 
Tracker's Knife
, which did not upgrade 
 
Smite
 but stored sight 
 
wards
. 
 
Tracker's Knife
 was eventually removed in 
V8.4
, largely due to its staleness in higher-level and professional play (where vision is strongly valued).

In 
Season Eleven
, enchantments were removed. In their place, 
 
Emberknife
 or 
 
Hailblade
 were introduced as started items that would eventually be consumed after 5 uses of the summoner spell, at which point Smite would gain a one of two unique effects, 
 
Challenging Smite
 and 
 
Chilling Smite
, respectively.

Turrets
, also called 
towers
, are heavy fortifications that attack enemy units on sight. Turrets are a core component of 
League of Legends
. They deal damage to enemies and provide vision to their team, allowing them to have static and persistent control over the battlefield. Turrets target one unit at a time and deal heavy damage. Teams must destroy enemy turrets to push their assault into enemy territory.

There are 11 turrets per team on 
 
Summoner's Rift
 and 4 on 
 
Howling Abyss
.

Outer turret features:

 
Turret Plating
: Outer turrets have large stone shields attached called plates. Plates are segments of the turret's health. Turrets start with five plates, each with 1000 health, meaning that they start with 5000 health. When a champion destroys a plate, they and nearby allies get a gold reward. However, the turret then gains damage resistance, thus becoming slightly harder to destroy. Plates disappear 14 minutes into the game, along with their extra damage resistance. When this happens, the crystals embued on the remaining plates will flicker as a visual indicator and announcing messages both visually and audibly can be seen and heard 30 seconds before their removal.

Notes

Turrets have a 
 
sight
 radius of 
 1350 and an 
 attack range
 of 
 750. Their shots travel at a speed of 1200 and are unblockable 
 
projectiles
. They are also 
 
immune to crowd control
 except 
 
stasis
.

If a turret is destroyed while one of its shots is in mid-flight, that shot will not deal damage.

Turrets are units located on top of impassable 
terrain
. This terrain remains even after the turret is destroyed.

Effects that interact with terrain will do so for both functional and destroyed turrets.

Items

Turrets have a pseudo-inventory which consists of items that grant them additional effects, similarly to the inventories of champions. Each of these items provide the turret with mechanics that improve their overall offense and defense on the battlefield. The following section lists them with their passive effects:

 
Fortification

Unique Passive - Fortification:
 85% damage reduction from all sources. This effect expires after 5 minutes.

 
Ohmwrecker

Unique Passive:
 Gains 30% armor penetration.

Unique Passive - Dodge Piercing:
 Turret attacks, once their windup has completed, cannot be evaded, 
parried
, nor 
 
intercepted
. They will be still be 
 
destroyed by effects that 'pop' homing projectiles
, such as their target becoming 
 
untargetable
.

Unique Passive - Warming Up:
 The damage dealt by turrets increases by 40% each time they hit a 
 
champion
, up to 120% bonus damage. This effect resets 3 seconds after the last shot hits a champion, but it doesn't reset when switching targets.

 
Reinforced Armor

Unique Passive - Reinforced Armor:
 
Reduces
 incoming damage by 80%, including 
 
true damage
, when no enemy 
 
minions
 or 
 
Summoned Rift Herald
 are nearby.

 
Pets
, 
 
traps
, and 
 
neutral monsters
 do not deactivate this effect.

 
Base Turret Reinforced Armor

Unique Passive - Reinforced Armor:
 
Reduces
 incoming damage by 80%, including 
 
true damage
, when no enemy 
 
minions
 or 
 
Summoned Rift Herald
 are nearby.

Unique Passive:
 Base turrets have 
 
health regeneration
, but this regeneration is limited by their 
Champions killed with Comeuppance (R)
current
 health
:

Champions killed with Comeuppance (R)
Current
 health
 between 
inherit
67%
 and 
inherit
100%
: Regenerate up to 
Champions killed with Comeuppance (R)
100% health
.

Champions killed with Comeuppance (R)
Current
 health
 between 
inherit
34%
 and 
inherit
66%
: Regenerate up to 
Champions killed with Comeuppance (R)
66% health
.

Champions killed with Comeuppance (R)
Current
 health
 below 
inherit
34%
: Regenerate up to 
Champions killed with Comeuppance (R)
33% health
.

 
Warden's Eye

Unique Passive - 
 
True Sight
:
 Can see all units and traps (including those in 
 
stealth
) within 1000 range, unless the direct line of vision is obstructed (e.g. by terrain).

Turret rewards

Destroying a turret grants two gold rewards to the team that destroys it: a 
global reward
 and a 
local reward
.

The global reward is given to all the champions in the team.

The local reward is shared between all champions alive and within 1200 range of the turret at the moment of its destruction. Additionally, if a champion deals the killing blow directly, they will alway earns their share of the reward whether they are 
 
dead
 or not.

Champions who are alive and have assisted in destroying the turret by dealing damage to it directly or via their summons (including the 
 
Rift Herald Mercenary
) within the last 
10 seconds
 receive their share as well, 
regardless of range
.

The paradigm for local rewards also apply to the distributed reward from destroying 
 
Turret Plating
 stages.

The local reward for destroying the 
first turret
 (also referred to as "Turret First Blood" and "First Turret gold") grants 
 
300 
bonus
 gold
.

Target selection

Turrets attack the first enemy unit that comes into their range and continue attacking that unit until it dies, leaves the attack range of the turret, or stops being targetable. When the current target is lost by any means, the turret selects a new target. If several targets are in range, the turret chooses its new target by following this priority list (they will attack the closest and most prioritized enemy):

 
Shaco's
 
 
Jack in the Box

Pets
 (e.g. 
 
Tibbers
, 
 
Voidlings
).

 
Siege minion
 or 
 
super minion
.

 
Mist Walkers
.

 
Melee minion
.

 
Caster minion
.

 
Yorick's
 
 
Maiden of the Mist
.

 
Champion
.

However, if an enemy champion deals damage to an allied champion who is within 1400 range of a turret, the turret switches targets to attack the enemy champion. The damage can come from any source, including 
pets
. Turrets don't attack enemy champions using non-damaging spells, like 
 
Karthus'
 
 
Wall of Pain
. They will still attack them if the spell or attack is blocked by a 
 
spell shield
 or if the attack triggers 
combat effects
.

Damaging turrets

A turret can only be targeted and damaged if it is the outermost structure standing in its lane. Turrets located behind the outermost standing turrets are 
invulnerable and untargetable
 until the outermost one is destroyed. This means that inner turrets only become vulnerable when their respective outer turret is destroyed, and inhibitor turrets only become vulnerable when their respective inner turret is destroyed. Nexus turrets are only vulnerable if one or more of their inhibitors are destroyed.

Turrets fall apart as they take damage.

Turrets are not valid targets to most abilities, spells and auras. Exceptions are listed in the lists below. 
Basic attacks
 don't apply health based damage modifiers or critical strikes, unless otherwise stated. 
Armor penetration
 and 
magic penetration
 are factored into the damage dealt to any structure. Some 
on-hit
 effects can apply to structures and/or turrets.

Unmodified basic attacks' damage against turrets is 
Champions stunned with Pyromania (P)
100% 
base
 AD
 
Champions stunned with Pyromania (P)
(+ 100% 
bonus
 AD)
 
Multiple champions hit with Between Worlds (R)
(+ 60% AP)
. The damage type depends on 
Damage to champions with Center of the Universe (P)
ability power
 and 
Champions hit with Bandage Toss (Q) at greater than 75% of max range
bonus
 attack damage
:

Physical damage if 
Champions stunned with Pyromania (P)
100% 
bonus
 AD
 > 
Multiple champions hit with Between Worlds (R)
60% AP
.

Magic damage if 
Champions stunned with Pyromania (P)
100% 
bonus
 AD
 < 
Multiple champions hit with Between Worlds (R)
60% AP
.

The 
 
Demolish
 rune helps to destroy turrets quickly. When a champion with the 
Demolish
 rune is within the range of a turret, 6 crystals appear around the turret's base. These crystals act as a countdown timer that indicates when the turret will be vulnerable to 
Demolish
.

Strategy

Turrets can be used to create choke points using traps such as 
 
Caitlyn's
 
 
Yordle Snap Trap
, especially in the narrow areas between a turret and nearby terrain, as minions will not normally walk through those areas of lanes.

On Summoner's Rift, the majority of champions during the 
early game
 have enough base 
 
Champions hit with Bandage Toss (Q) at greater than 75% of max range
attack damage
 (including any sufficient passive 
attack effects
 such as 
 
Clockwork Windup
) to last hit minions with assistance from turrets by using only 
basic attacks
. Assuming that minions have taken none or negligible damage from other sources prior to or during being attacked by the turret:

Melee minions may sustain two turret attacks, and then one champion attack to last hit.

Ranged minions may sustain one champion attack, then one turret attack, then another champion attack to last hit.

Destroying the five stacks of 
 
Turret Plating
 grants a total of 
 
625
 (125 × 5 plates), plus 
 
300
 (250 local gold bounty for the Outer turret + 50 global gold bounty for taking down a turret) for a total of ​​​​​
 
925
. If this is the first turret to go down (First Turret gold), it also locally grants an additional 
 
150
, for a maximum possible total of 
 
1075
 from a single Outer turret before 14 minutes.

Turrets have one of the largest hitboxes in the game, so it is possible for enemies to misclick into the turrets instead of into the player.

Turret Variants

League of Legends have had numerous different turrets during its history. Most were primarily used for Summoner's Rift while the remaining ones for ARAM, Twisted Treeline, and other game modes.

Trivia

Whenever a turret is destroyed, the crystal where its attacks originate from shatters and drops on the ground.

 
Warmed up
 attacks evolve stage by stage (up to four):

Attack orbs and their launch visual become larger and brighter, and their colors blend more smoothly with the trajectory's colors.

Attack trajectories transform to an erratic line pattern and gain particle effects.

Hit VFX become brighter, larger and gain a lensing effect.

Sometimes, the base layer of the map (cyan/blue color, normally) is visible through a destroyed turret's base.
(bug)

Older versions of League of Legends used to feature up to three different models of turrets per faction. In the latest version however, all turrets of one faction use the same model.

Order's and Chaos' turrets have several visual and technical differences:

The crystal atop Chaos turrets' staff appears to be floating, whereas it is directly attached onto the Order turrets' staff.

Chaos' 
Nexus Obelisk
 uniquely does not resemble its respective turrets, unlike Order. On 
Howling Abyss
, one single standard Order turret functions as Order's Nexus Obelisk, while Chaos has none and their Obelisk is replaced by a purple eye attached to the nearby gate instead.

Based on the visuals, theoretically a destroyed Chaos turret sustains less structural damage when taken down than an Order turret. Also, destroyed Order turret's ornaments slowly fade away while Chaos' sink into the ground.

In their current design iteration, the Order faction turrets' staves have the shape of a hammer, while the Chaos faction turrets' staves have the shape of a spear or halberd.

On Summoner's Rift, Chaos turrets have their base detached from their pedestals, as if floating. The only part that is attached to the pedestals and the terrains are their staves.

One of the old turret variants used the old 
 
Baron Nashor
 model for the lane turrets.

 
Turret Plating
 is effective at the start of the game, but an animation plays from 0:25 to 0:32 that shows Outer turrets as "armoring up" while plates form around it.

The icons for turrets' passives/items are reused from previous game assets.

 
Ohmwrecker
 uses the icon of 
 
Ohmwrecker
, an item that was removed in 
Season Ten
.

Before that, it was called 
 
Penetrating Bullets
, which used the icon of 
 
Skull Crusher
, an 
alpha item
 with unknown effects.

 
Reinforced Armor
 uses the icon of 
 
Netherrift Armor
, an alpha item with unknown effects.

 
Turret Plating
 uses the icon of 
 
Vanguard
, a removed turret buff.

 
Warden's Eye
 uses the icon of 
 
Vision Ward
, a removed item.

 
Fortification
 uses the icon of 
 
Fortify
, a removed summoner spell.

In the oldest versions of the game, Nexuses used to be targetable by enemies even while turrets were defending it. This allowed a team to destroy the enemy Nexus directly. The only way this is possible in the current patch is by the 
the enemy team surrendering
.

Turrets were featured in the obscure mobile game 
League of Legends: Turret Defence
.

========================================
## 억제기 (Inhibitor)
원본 링크: https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Inhibitor
========================================

Inhibitors
 are structures that prevent 
 
super minions
 from spawning in the respective same lane. Inhibitors have 4000 
health
, 15 
health regeneration
 per second, 20 
armor
, and 0 
magic resistance
.

Each team has 3 inhibitors on 
Summoner's Rift
 in each of their bases, of which at least one inhibitor must be destroyed to render the Nexus and its defending turrets vulnerable to being attacked (the Nexus will be invulnerable as long as one of its turrets or all 3 inhibitors are standing). Every inhibitor is protected by a turret that makes that inhibitor invulnerable; destroying the turret makes the inhibitor vulnerable.

Once a team's inhibitor is destroyed, the enemy's 
Nexus
 will begin spawning a 
 
super minion
 in the waves set in the respective lane, replacing the 
 
siege minion
 in its place if applicable. If all 3 of a team's inhibitors are destroyed, it will instead spawn two 
 
super minions
 in each lane, per wave.

Destroyed inhibitors respawn after 5 minutes, therefore stopping the opposing Nexus from spawning any more 
 
super minions
.

Bounty

When an inhibitor is destroyed, if a champion scored the last hit, they receive 
 
50
. Other champions involved in the destruction do not receive any bounty.

Notes

Inhibitors do not have any special buffs or effects.

Armor penetration
 has no effect on an inhibitor's armor.

The damage dealt to an inhibitor with a basic attack is the sum of the 
 
Champions hit with Bandage Toss (Q) at greater than 75% of max range
base
 attack damage
, plus the higher of 
Champions hit with Bandage Toss (Q) at greater than 75% of max range
bonus
 attack damage
 and 60% of 
 
Damage to champions with Center of the Universe (P)
ability power
. If 60% of a champion's 
Damage to champions with Center of the Universe (P)
ability power
 is greater the amount of their 
Champions hit with Bandage Toss (Q) at greater than 75% of max range
bonus
 attack damage
, the attack's damage converts from 
 
physical damage
 to 
 
magic damage
.

When the announcer notifies that either yours or the enemy's inhibitor will respawn soon, said inhibitor will respawn in 15 seconds.

In 
Summoner's Rift
, destroying an Inhibitor will spawn a Super Minion in each wave for the next 8 minion waves. Usually two minion waves before the Inhibitor completely recovers will not have any Super Minions.

In 
Howling Abyss
, destroying the Inhibitor will spawn a Super Minion in each wave for the next 10 minion waves.

Respawn timer for an inhibitor can be seen visually through a glowing gauge running around the destroyed inhibitor's framing.

Strategy

Once its protecting turret is destroyed the inhibitor is extremely susceptible to 
backdooring
. An enemy 
 
marksman
 will be able to take down an unprotected inhibitor before a defending champion can 
 
Recall
 and walk to defend it. Additionally, one can't directly 
 
Teleport
 to it. Destroying an inhibitor can often be worth more than a few champion kills because of the immense lane pressure that Super Minions will provide. Players have to keep in mind when an inhibitor respawns, however, as it respawning means that the Nexus cannot take damage; this notably happened in game 2 of EDG vs DRX during the 2022 League of Legends World Championships quarterfinals, when DRX's Deft was just about to finish EDG's Nexus, only to be stopped when one of the opposing team's inhibitors respawned, costing DRX the game.

Inhibitor Variants

League of Legends have had numerous different inhibitors during its history. Most were primarily used for Summoner's Rift while the remaining ones for ARAM, Twisted Treeline, and other game modes.

Patch History

V12.6
 - March 31st Hotfix

Bug Fix:
 Health regeneration per second reverted to 15 from 0.

V12.6

Undocumented:
 Health regeneration per second reduced to 0 from 15.

V7.15

Bug Fix:
 Now accurately display the 20 armor they have.

V4.20

Context
: 
At the beginning of the 2014 season we shortened the respawn time of inhibitors. Now, with our LASER-BUFFED BASE TURRETS (shouting is mandatory here), we can put inhibitor respawns back to their original timing so that attacking teams have a better window to capitalize on their achievements.

Inhibitor death timers increased to 5 minutes (from 4 minutes).

V3.14

Context
: 
Losing an inhibitor often puts a team behind for a long period of time with few opportunities for retaliation. This was because a downed inhibitor also granted a global buff to minions in all lanes. We want more comeback opportunities for teams who can capitalize on winning teamfights, even with a downed inhibitor.

Inhibitor death timers reduced to 4 minutes (from 5 minutes).

Inhibitors no longer grant a global buff to all minions when destroyed.

The bonus amount ranged and melee minions receive was previously based on the number of enemy inhibitors destroyed as their wave spawned.

Inhibitors now grant a stronger damage and durability buff to minions in their specific lane.

V1.0.0.96

Inhibitor death timers changed to 5 minutes.

The respawn time previously increased every time the inhibitor was destroyed.

Lethality

Lethality
.

Champion skillshot and targetted missiles evaded with Hallowed Mist (W)
 
Armor penetration
 is a 
champion statistic
 that determines the amount of a target's 
 
armor
 that will be ignored when the user deals 
physical damage
. 
Percentage armor penetration
 and 
Lethality
 have no effect if the target's armor is less than or equal to 0.

Armor reduction
 is an effect that reduces the target's armor for a period of time, by an amount or percentage. 
Flat
 armor reduction can reduce armor values below 0, while 
percentage
 armor reduction cannot.

It is important to note that 
penetration
 
treats
 the target's resistances as being multiplied by a percentage or reduced by a flat amount, in contrast to 
reduction
 which applies to the target's resistances as a whole.

All champions have 0 base armor penetration and lethality, but they can be increased by 
items
, 
runes
, and with certain champions' passive 
ability
 effects.

Starting in 
V6.22
, 
lethality
 replaced 
flat armor penetration
 as a statistic, and offered 
40.
33
% − 100% (based on target's level)
 of the value as penetration.
[
1
]
 In 
V7.14
, it was changed to scale with the user's level instead of the target's level, offering 
62.
22
% − 100% (based on level)
 of the value as penetration. In 
V14.1
 
lethality
 was changed back to no longer scale by level; it grants the full amount of 
flat armor penetration
 at all levels, but keeps the name to differentiate it from 
percent armor penetration
 and emphasize its relative effectiveness against low-armor enemies rather than high-armor enemies.
[
2
]
 In 
V14.9
, 
lethality
 was updated to be handled as an innate statistic rather than a scripted one.

Order of calculations

Armor penetration and armor reduction are considered in the following order:
[
3
]

Armor reduction, flat

Armor reduction, percentage

Armor penetration, percentage

Armor penetration, flat (Lethality)

Base
 armor and 
bonus
 armor are calculated separately.

Flat armor reduction

The target's armor is reduced by an amount. Flat armor reduction 
 
stacks additively
 and is distributed proportionally between base armor and bonus armor.

Example: 15 armor reduction against a 20 base armor and 40 bonus armor target will reduce base armor by 5 and bonus armor by 10, so the target will be reduced to 45 armor (
(20 − 5) 
+ 
 (40 − 10) = 45
)
.

Flat armor reduction can reduce a target's armor below zero. For example, if an enemy with 10 armor has their armor reduced by 25, the enemy will have −15 armor.

Percentage armor reduction

The target's armor is multiplied by a percentage (100% − the listed reduction). Applies to both base and bonus armor. Percentage armor reduction 
 
stacks multiplicatively
 and is ignored if the target's armor is 0 or less.

Example: 30% armor reduction multiplies the target's armor to 70%, so a target with 20 base armor and 40 bonus armor will be reduced to 42 armor (
(20 × 0.
7
) + (
40 × 0.
7
)
 = 42)
.

Percentage armor reduction reduces more armor on targets with higher armor. For instance, with 40% armor reduction, a target with 200 armor will lose 80 while a target with only 50 armor will lose 20. 

With 40% armor reduction, the physical damage dealt to a target with 50 armor is only increased by around 15%, whereas the physical damage dealt to a target with 200 armor is increased by around 36%.

If one wanted to calculate the total armor reduction after two consecutive percent armor reductions, the following formula may be useful:

{\displaystyle CumulativePercentArmorPenetration=r_1+r_2-r_1r_2=(.2)+(.3)-(.2)(.3)=44\%
}

Percentage armor penetration

The target's armor is treated as being multiplied by a percentage for purposes of damage calculation (100% − the listed penetration). Percentage armor penetration 
 
stacks multiplicatively
 and is ignored if the target's armor is 0 or less.

Example: 30% armor penetration causes the target to take damage as if its armor was multiplied by 70%, so a target with 
20 base armor and 40 bonus armor will be treated as though it had 42 for purposes of damage 
 (the target's actual armor value will not change, however) 
(
(20 × 0.
7
)
 + 
(40 × 0.
7
) = 42).

Because the target's actual armor value does not change, anything else depending on that value also doesn't change.

Percentage armor penetration reduces more armor on targets with higher armor. For instance, with 40% armor penetration, a target with 200 armor will be considered as having 80 less while a target with only 50 armor will be considered as having 20 less.

Gold Value

Percent armor penetration
 has a gold value of 
 
41.
666667
 per point.

Percentage bonus armor penetration

Percentage armor penetration that applies only to 
bonus
 armor.

Example: 30% bonus armor penetration multiplies the target's bonus armor to 70% without affecting base armor, so a target with 20 base armor and 40 bonus armor 
will be treated as though it had 48 for purposes of damage calculation (the target's actual armor value will not change, however).
 (
20
 + (
40 × 0.
7
)
 = 48)
. 

If the unit has multiple sources of percentage bonus penetration, they stack multiplicatively:

Example: 10% armor penetration and 30% bonus armor penetration
.
 (
20  × 0.
9
))
 + (
40 × 0.
7
 × 0.
9
)
)
 = 43.2)
. 

Because the target's actual armor value does not change, anything else depending on that value also doesn't change.

Percentage bonus armor penetration reduces more armor on targets with higher 
bonus
 armor, but will not have an effect against base armor. For instance, with 40% 
bonus
 armor penetration, a target with 200 
bonus
 armor will be considered as having 80 less while a target with only 50 
bonus
 armor will be considered as having 20 less. In contrast, a target with any amount of base armor and no 
bonus
 armor will be considered as having the same value.

Lethality

Lethality
 is the statistic that represents and grants flat armor penetration.

The target's armor is treated as being reduced by an amount for the purposes of damage calculation, but cannot be reduced below 0. Flat armor penetration 
 
stacks additively
.

Example: 20 lethality on a user will cause a target to take damage as if its armor was 20 less, so a target with 30 armor will be treated as though it had 10 for purposes of damage calculation (the target's actual armor value will not change, however).

Because the target's actual armor value does not change, anything else depending on that value also doesn't change.

Gold Value

Lethality
 has a gold value of 
 
30
 per point, for more details see 
this page
.

Examples

Given 10 flat armor penetration and 45% bonus armor penetration, and the target is affected by 30 flat armor reduction and 30% armor reduction;

Target A has 300 armor (100 base and 200 bonus armor).

The 300 is reduced to 270 (90 base and 180 bonus armor) by the 30 armor reduction.

The 270 is reduced to 189 (63 base and 126 bonus armor) by the 30% armor reduction.

The 189 is considered to be 132.
3
 (63 base and 69.
3
 bonus armor) by the 45% bonus armor penetration.

The 132.
3
 is considered to be 122.
3
 by the 10 armor penetration.

Target A takes damage as if it has 122.
3
 armor.

Target B has 18 armor.

The 18 is reduced to −12 by the 30 armor reduction.

The −12 is not affected by any further calculations because it is less than 0.

Target B takes damage as if it has −12 armor.

Notes

Armor penetration will apply to any and all sources of 
 
physical damage
.

It will apply to the damage dealt to almost every type of unit, including 
 
turrets
 but not other structures (
Inhibitors
 are the only building with armor).

Armor reduction will affect the physical damage from any unit source.

Percentage penetration is applied before flat penetration.

 
Turrets
 and 
 
Dragons
 have 30% armor penetration.

 
Gangplank's
 
 
Powder Keg
 is special cased to ignore a percentage of the target's armor with its damage.

 
Yasuo's
 
 
Last Breath
 grants him a buff that causes the damage dealt by his critical strikes to ignore a percentage of the target's bonus armor.

Damage to champions with Signature of the Visionary (P)
 
Magic penetration
 (also referred to as 
Damage to champions with Signature of the Visionary (P)
 
MPen
) is a 
champion statistic
 that determines the amount of a target's 
 
magic resistance
 that will be ignored when the user deals 
magic damage
. 
Percentage magic penetration
 and 
flat magic penetration
 have no effect if the target's magic resistance is less than or equal to 0.

Magic resistance reduction
 is an effect that reduces the target's magic resistance for a period of time, by an amount or percentage. 
Flat
 magic resistance reduction can reduce the value below 0, while 
percentage
 magic resistance reduction cannot.

It is important to note that 
penetration
 
treats
 the target's resistances as being multiplied by a percentage or reduced by a flat amount, in contrast to 
reduction
 which applies to the target's resistances as a whole.

All champions have 0 base flat magic penetration and percent magic penetration, but they can be increased by 
items
, 
runes
, and with certain champions' passive 
ability
 effects.

Order of calculations

Magic penetration and magic resistance reduction are considered in the following order:
[
1
]

Magic resistance reduction, flat

Magic resistance reduction, percentage

Magic penetration, percentage

Magic penetration, flat

Flat magic resistance reduction

The target's magic resistance is reduced by an amount. Flat magic resistance reduction 
 
stacks additively
.

Example: 20 magic resistance reduction reduces the target's magic resistance by 20, so a target with 30 magic resistance will be reduced to 10 magic resistance. 
(30 − 20 = 10)

Flat magic resistance reduction can reduce a target's magic resistance below zero. For example, if an enemy with 10 magic resistance has their magic resistance reduced by 25, the enemy will have −15 magic resistance.

Percentage magic resistance reduction

The target's magic resistance is multiplied by a percentage (100% − the listed reduction). Percentage magic resistance reduction 
 
stacks multiplicatively
 and is ignored if the target's magic resistance is 0 or less.

Example: 20% magic resistance reduction multiplies the target's magic resistance to 80%, so a target with 30 magic resistance will be reduced to 24 magic resist. 
(30 × 0.
8
 = 24)

Percentage magic resistance reduction reduces more magic resistance on targets with higher magic resistance. For instance, with 40% magic resistance reduction, a target with 200 magic resistance will lose 80 while a target with only 50 magic resistance will lose 20.

Percentage magic penetration

The target's magic resistance is treated as being multiplied by a percentage for purposes of damage calculation (100% − the listed penetration). Percentage magic penetration 
 
stacks multiplicatively
 and is ignored if the target's magic resistance is 0 or less.

Example: 20% magic penetration causes the target to take damage as if its magic resistance was multiplied by 80%, so a target with 30 magic resistance will be treated as though it had 24 for purposes of damage calculation (the target's actual magic resistance value will not change, however).

Because the target's actual magic resistance value does not change, anything else depending on that value also doesn't change.

Percentage magic penetration reduces more magic resistance on targets with higher magic resistance. For instance, with 40% magic penetration, a target with 200 magic resistance will be considered as having 80 less while a target with only 50 magic resistance will be considered as having 20 less.

Gold Value

​​

Percentage magic penetration
 has a gold value of 
 
46.
15
 per point.

Flat magic penetration

The target's magic resistance is treated as being reduced by an amount for purposes of damage calculation, but cannot be reduced below 0. Flat magic penetration 
 
stacks additively
.

Example: 20 magic penetration causes the target to take damage as if its magic resistance was 20 less, so a target with 30 magic resistance will be treated as though it had 10 for purposes of damage calculation (the target's actual magic resistance value will not change, however).

Because the target's actual magic resistance value does not change, anything else depending on that value also doesn't change.

Gold Value

​​

Flat magic penetration
 has a gold value of 
 
37.
33
 per point.

Examples

Given 10 flat magic penetration and 35% magic penetration, and the target is affected by 20 flat magic resistance reduction and 30% magic resistance reduction;

Target A has 80 magic resistance.

The 80 is reduced to 60 by the 20 magic resistance reduction.

The 60 is reduced to 42 by the 30% magic resistance reduction.

The 42 is considered to be 27.
3
 by the 35% magic resistance penetration.

The 27.
3
 is considered to be 17.
3
 by the 10 magic resistance penetration.

Target A takes damage as if it has 17.
3
 magic resistance.

Target B has 18 magic resistance.

The 18 is reduced to −2 by the 20 magic resistance reduction.

The −2 is not affected by any further calculations because it is less than 0.

Target B takes damage as if it has −2 magic resistance.

Gameplay

Monster behavior & Patience

Monsters reside in the 
jungle
, and will not move from their designated camp until attacked, at which point they become aggressive (are "
aggroed
"). When aggroed, the monster will acquire the nearest champion, regardless of 
 
vision
, and then attempt to attack them back. Monsters' distance to their target considers walking travel distance (pathing distance), 
not
 straight line distance.

Monsters have a maximum radius they can move before they start to lose their 
patience
. This distance is called 
leash range
 and is indicated by a flowing circle around the camp's location that appears for each player when they initiate combat with that monster (with the exception of 
 
Baron Nashor
, who is stationary). 
Leash range
 varies per camp. If the monster is unable to find their acquired target (e.g. the champion enters 
 
stealth
) or moves outside of its 
leash range
, its patience will start to deplete. Patience depletes faster the farther away the monster is from its maximum leash range and/or the less it is attacked while being there. Non-epic monsters' patience also drops when they change targets. Their target can change up to 6 times before their patience fully depletes.

When a monster's patience reaches zero, it will enter a state of 
soft reset
 for 6 seconds. While in this state, the monster will begin walking back toward its neutral position, healing for 
Champions killed with Comeuppance (R)
6% of its 
maximum
 health
 every second and ignoring calls for aggression from its attackers until it has returned inside its 
leash range
. Attacking a monster while it is within its 
leash range
 ends this 
soft reset
 prematurely to restore some of its patience and prevent it from losing any further patience for 1.
5
 seconds.

When the 
soft reset
 grace period ends, the monster will enter a state of 
hard reset
 instead, again ignoring all attackers, but now healing at a much faster rate and running back to its neutral position more rapidly. Once the monsters have returned to the camp's neutral position, they will recover their patience after 2 seconds of their arrival and over 2 seconds.

Notes

Small monsters match the patience of their respective large monster as long as it is alive and within 700 units.

Vision of a champion applies to the entire camp of monsters not only e.g. the largest monster in the camp.

When the large monster of a camp dies, all other smaller monsters in their camp will be 
marked for death
 for 10 seconds. After 10 seconds of not being in combat with a champion, the marked monsters will die.

Monsters can have different range types.

The following monsters are 
 
melee
:

 
Ancient Krug
, 
 
Krugs
, and 
 
Mini Krugs

 
Blue Sentinel

 
Greater Murk Wolf
 and 
 
Murk Wolves

 
Raptor

 
Red Brambleback

 
Rift Herald

 
Voidmite

The following monsters are 
 
ranged
:

 
Baron Nashor

 
Crimson Raptor

 
Dragons
 (
 
 
 
 
 
 
)

 
Gromp

 
Rift Scuttler
 (does not attack when provoked, but is technically ranged)

 
Voidgrub

Camp respawn

After a camp has been completely cleared, it will remain empty for an amount of time specific to that camp (its "respawn time"), then all of the monsters will reappear. A camp's respawn timer can be viewed in the 
scoreboard
. An accurate timer can only be given to the ally team if the ally team had vision of the camp when it was cleared; however, gaining vision of the camp's location at any point may still provide an accurate timer on the minimap when the camp is close to spawning (a greyed out timer means 60 seconds remaining, a filled one means 10 seconds remaining until respawn). This does not apply to epic monster camps, which will always provide an accurate timer and be announced to both teams when cleared.

When a non-epic monster camp is cleared outside of vision, it is not possible to know that an enemy has recently been at that location.

A monster camp will not respawn until 
all
 of the monsters in the camp have died. For example, if the 
 
Greater Murk Wolf
 has been slain, but at least one of its two 
 
Murk Wolf
 companions has not, the camp's respawn timer will not start until the last Wolf has been slain. The game will automatically kill any remaining lesser monsters in a camp whose large monster has been killed, after 10 seconds of them returning to a neutral state. This allows them to respawn automatically as well, albeit with this important delay.

Monster Rewards

As a general rule, killing a monster rewards its killer with 
 
gold
 and 
 
experience
. 

Killing a large monster without a jungle item (
 
Gustwalker Hatchling
, 
 
Mosstomper Seedling
, or 
 
Scorchclaw Pup
) reduces its bounty by 
 
15
 and its experience by 
inherit
15
, modified to 
inherit
12
 when killing the 
 
Ancient Krug
.

Additionally, certain large monsters offer greater rewards when killed, such as an individual 
buff
, a team buff, or a global gold and/or experience reward.

The 
 
Crest of Insight
 and 
 
Crest of Cinders
 buffs are gained respectively from the 
 
Blue Sentinel
 and the 
 
Red Brambleback
, and may be transferred to another champion. This occurs when a champion kills someone holding a crest, causing the crest to be transferred to the killer and resetting the buffs duration. Either buff disappears entirely if the champion holding the crest is executed by a minion, monster, or tower, or when the crest simply wear offs on its own after a few minutes.

When the map transforms into the 
Elemental Rift
, the 
 
Blue Sentinel
 and the 
 
Red Brambleback
 become 
Draconic
, gaining this form if alive and respawning in it each time. Killing them in this form leaves behind a buff wisp at the camp's location for 60 seconds. The wisp can be picked up by an allied champion moving near it, granting them the buff. If the killer did not have 
 
Smite
, the wisp can only be picked up by a champion that does so.

Once the 
 
Baron Nashor
 spawns at 
20:00
, the 
 
Blue Sentinel
 and the 
 
Red Brambleback
 become permanently corrupted by the 
Void
 if they are not 
Draconic
, transforming into a 
Voidborn
 with 30% increased health. Killing them in this form grants you and all your allied champions, if alive, the buff. Any remaining 
Draconic
 
 
Blue Sentinel
 or 
 
Red Brambleback
 that are slain respawn as 
Voidborn
 instead.

The 
 
Eye of the Herald
 buff can be picked up by the team that delivered the killing blow to the 
 
Rift Herald
, lasting for 4 minutes. This buff allows the holder to summon the 
Rift Herald
 on their team, which will then head to the closest lane to assist in pushing the lane until it dies.

The stacking 
 
Dragon Slayer
 buffs acquired for slaying the 
 
Dragon
 are applied to all team members, whether living or dead, and last indefinitely. The exception to this is the 
 
Aspect of the Dragon
 from the 
 
Elder Dragon
, which is only granted to living teammates and lasts for a few minutes and is lost upon death.

The 
 
Touch of the Void
 buff is granted to all teammates when a 
 
Voidgrub
 is slain. The buff stacks for each grub killed.

At 4 or more stacks of this buff, it also grants the 
 
Hunger of the Void
.

The 
 
Hand of Baron
 buff is only granted to living teammates when 
 
Baron Nashor
 is killed. The buff lasts for a few minutes and is lost upon death.

Monsters spawn at level 1 when spawning for the first time, and their level is re-calculated only when they respawn. These exclude epic monsters, which start the game at higher levels and upgrade automatically per game time, akin to 
 
minions
.

Monster experience reward

While owning a jungle item (
 
Gustwalker Hatchling
, 
 
Mosstomper Seedling
, or 
 
Scorchclaw Pup
), gain 
Champions killed with Trueshot Barrage (R)
80 
bonus
 experience
 from killing large monsters. Your first monster kill grants 
Champions killed with Trueshot Barrage (R)
150 
bonus
 experience
.

Lore

Summoner's Rift

Historically, the forest where the Rift resides was the site of several battles between the Protectorate (Stag crest) and Magelords (Owl crest) summoners, two sides who sought out to use the natural magical energy of the area for their personal use.

The large amount of concentrated magic has mutated the local wildlife. From 
 
giant frogs
, 
 
Giant Birds
 to 
 
Two-headed Wolves
 it has also attracted the attention of powerful 
 
Dragons
 who currently reside in one of the battle torn ruins. 
 
Sentinels
, 
 
Bramblebacks
 and 
 
Krugs
 are creatures made from local flora and earth infused to construct a magical being. The Rift's unstable magic has inadvertently cause the reemergence of 
 
Baron Nashor
, a large Serpent/Worm largely believed to be dead for centuries. It has his corruption affecting the land around him.

Twisted Treeline

After the fall of the Shadow Isles, the islands inhabitants were changed by 
the Black Mist
. Numerous individuals and creatures now serve the 
Harrowing
's will.

 
Vilemaw
 is an ancient spider of unknown origin currently residing in the cursed forest. The 
"Cult of the Spider"
 has most of its followers located in 
Noxus
 and 
Demacia
. 
 
Elise
 serves as its High Priestess, traveling to and from between the two nations and the 
Shadow Isles
, bringing her followers to live with the Spider God, Vilemaw, for eternity, or so they believe.

Bilgewater

Various monsters from across Runeterra, such as the 
 
Ironbacks
, 
 
Ocklepods
, 
 
Plundercrabs
, and 
 
Razorfins
 are shipped through the black market and used for 
monster brawls
.

Patch History

V12.22

New Effect:
 When a monster loses all of its patience, it will 
soft reset
 for 6 seconds instead of fully resetting its patience. While in the process of 
soft resetting
, the monster will path towards the center of its camp, heal for 
Champions killed with Comeuppance (R)
6% of its 
maximum
 health
 every second, and ignore attackers outside of its leash range.

Attacking a monster while it is within its leash range ends this 
soft reset
 prematurely to restore some of its patience and prevents it from being lost for 1.
5
 seconds.

If the 
soft reset
 ends from after 6 seconds, the monster will 
hard reset
 and in the process will ignore all attackers, rapidly heal, and path to its original position.

Monsters move slow while 
soft resetting
 and much more faster while 
hard resetting
.

New Effect:
 Monsters now regenerate patience that they have lost after 2 seconds of being back within their leash range.

New Effect:
 Small monsters now match the patience of their respective large monster as long as it is alive and within 700 units.

Monsters will get a temporary increase to their regeneration rate if they lose all their patience and retreat back to camp.

V5.19

Jungle monsters now have a 
Patience
 characteristic. Monsters no longer reset their aggression based on distance or positioning - Instead, once the monster's Patience is reduced to zero, the monster will reset and return to their original position. During this reset, they rapidly regenerate health and do not respond to further aggression.

Monsters lose Patience under the following conditions:

When a monster is in an aggressive state but can't find any targets to attack (ex. its target died or became untargetable)

When a monster's target is too far away from the monster's initial spawn location or the monster is VERY far away from its initial spawn location

When the monster is forced to switch targets

Large monsters display their Patience in a meter above their heads.

Once a monster has recovered to 90% health, they regain all of their 
Patience
.

Abilities that pull or displace monsters no longer completely reset the monster's aggro if they already had a previous target.
